and polygons:
- tetrahedron
- hexahedron

- dodecahedron
- icosahedron
- truncated icosahedron (football)
- geodesic spheres (level 1 to 10)

All fully scalable parts just like in the PART workbench.

How to use:
Activate the shape you want. Then adjust the sizes, as with classic Parts.

Note: this is a user-friendly version of existing macros.
